# EEEnc (WIP)
Ever wanted to express your data using the most holy letter of them all? Well now you can. And you can do it at lightning speed.

EEEnc takes advantage of the latest advancements in CPU design, including Intel's *Advanced Vector Extensions 2*â„¢ to speed up your
E-encoding.\*

\* NOTE: no benchmarks have been done.

## BUT WHY??
It's an inside joke at my high school's robotics club. You would not get it.

## How do I try it?
It's just like any other CMake project.

On Linux, simply run the following:
```sh
cmake -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build 
```

On Windows, open it in Visual Studio or CLion and hit build. It doesn't get any simpler than that.
